# Arduino Image Converter
A simple tool to load images onto an Arduino nano and display them via an 8x8 LED Matrix.
Still is missing some features but basicly it's pretty simple:
* Upload the example program onto your Arduino
* Launch the application, select your arduino port and connect
* Drag & drop an image (jpg/jpeg/png/bmp/gif)

And your arduino should display the image.
